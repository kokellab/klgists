        Calculate the prominence of each peak in a signal.

        The prominence of a peak measures how much a peak stands out from the
        surrounding baseline of the signal and is defined as the vertical distance
        between the peak and its lowest contour line.

        Parameters
        ----------
        x : sequence
            A signal with peaks.
        peaks : sequence
            Indices of peaks in `x`.
        wlen : int or float, optional
            A window length in samples that optionally limits the evaluated area for
            each peak to a subset of `x`. The peak is always placed in the middle of
            the window therefore the given length is rounded up to the next odd
            integer. This parameter can speed up the calculation (see Notes).

        Returns
        -------
        prominences : ndarray
            The calculated prominences for each peak in `peaks`.
        left_bases, right_bases : ndarray
            The peaks' bases as indices in `x` to the left and right of each peak.
            The higher base of each pair is a peak's lowest contour line.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If an index in `peaks` does not point to a local maximum in `x`.

        See Also
        --------
        find_peaks
            Find peaks inside a signal based on peak properties.
        peak_widths
            Calculate the width of peaks.

        Notes
        -----
        Strategy to compute a peak's prominence:

        1. Extend a horizontal line from the current peak to the left and right
           until the line either reaches the window border (see `wlen`) or
           intersects the signal again at the slope of a higher peak. An
           intersection with a peak of the same height is ignored.
        2. On each side find the minimal signal value within the interval defined
           above. These points are the peak's bases.
        3. The higher one of the two bases marks the peak's lowest contour line. The
           prominence can then be calculated as the vertical difference between the
           peaks height itself and its lowest contour line.

        Searching for the peak's bases can be slow for large `x` with periodic
        behavior because large chunks or even the full signal need to be evaluated
        for the first algorithmic step. This evaluation area can be limited with the
        parameter `wlen` which restricts the algorithm to a window around the
        current peak and can shorten the calculation time if the window length is
        short in relation to `x`.
        However this may stop the algorithm from finding the true global contour
        line if the peak's true bases are outside this window. Instead a higher
        contour line is found within the restricted window leading to a smaller
        calculated prominence. In practice this is only relevant for the highest set
        of peaks in `x`. This behavior may even be used intentionally to calculate
        "local" prominences.

        .. warning::

           This function may return unexpected results for data containing NaNs. To
           avoid this, NaNs should either be removed or replaced.

        >>> from scipy.signal import find_peaks, peak_prominences
        >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

        Create a test signal with two overlayed harmonics

        >>> x = np.linspace(0, 6 * np.pi, 1000)
        >>> x = np.sin(x) + 0.6 * np.sin(2.6 * x)

        Find all peaks and calculate prominences

        >>> peaks, _ = find_peaks(x)
        >>> prominences = peak_prominences(x, peaks)[0]
        >>> prominences
        array([1.24159486, 0.47840168, 0.28470524, 3.10716793, 0.284603  ,
               0.47822491, 2.48340261, 0.47822491])

        Calculate the height of each peak's contour line and plot the results

        >>> contour_heights = x[peaks] - prominences
        >>> plt.plot(x)
        >>> plt.plot(peaks, x[peaks], "x")
        >>> plt.vlines(x=peaks, ymin=contour_heights, ymax=x[peaks])
        >>> plt.show()

        Let's evaluate a second example that demonstrates several edge cases for
        one peak at index 5.

        >>> x = np.array([0, 1, 0, 3, 1, 3, 0, 4, 0])
        >>> peaks = np.array([5])
        >>> plt.plot(x)
        >>> plt.plot(peaks, x[peaks], "x")
        >>> plt.show()
        >>> peak_prominences(x, peaks)  # -> (prominences, left_bases, right_bases)
        (array([3.]), array([2]), array([6]))

        Note how the peak at index 3 of the same height is not considered as a
        border while searching for the left base. Instead two minima at 0 and 2
        are found in which case the one closer to the evaluated peak is always
        chosen. On the right side however the base must be placed at 6 because the
        higher peak represents the right border to the evaluated area.

        >>> peak_prominences(x, peaks, wlen=3.1)
        (array([2.]), array([4]), array([6]))

        Here we restricted the algorithm to a window from 3 to 7 (the length is 5
        samples because `wlen` was rounded up to the next odd integer). Thus the
        only two candidates in the evaluated area are the two neighbouring samples
        and a smaller prominence is calculated.

        Find peaks in a 1-D array with wavelet transformation.

        appear at enough length scales, and with sufficiently high SNR, are

        vector : ndarray

        widths : sequence

            this range should cover the expected width of peaks of interest.
        wavelet : callable, optional
            Should take two parameters and return a 1-D array to convolve
            with `vector`. The first parameter determines the number of points
            of the returned wavelet array, the second parameter is the scale
            (`width`) of the wavelet. Should be normalized and symmetric.
            Default is the ricker wavelet.
        max_distances : ndarray, optional
            At each row, a ridge line is only connected if the relative max at
            row[n] is within ``max_distances[n]`` from the relative max at
            ``row[n+1]``.  Default value is ``widths/4``.
        gap_thresh : float, optional
            If a relative maximum is not found within `max_distances`,
            there will be a gap. A ridge line is discontinued if there are more
            than `gap_thresh` points without connecting a new relative maximum.
            Default is the first value of the widths array i.e. widths[0].
        min_length : int, optional
            Minimum length a ridge line needs to be acceptable.
            Default is ``cwt.shape[0] / 4``, ie 1/4-th the number of widths.
        min_snr : float, optional
            Minimum SNR ratio. Default 1. The signal is the value of
            the cwt matrix at the shortest length scale (``cwt[0, loc]``), the
            noise is the `noise_perc`th percentile of datapoints contained within a
            window of `window_size` around ``cwt[0, loc]``.
        noise_perc : float, optional
            When calculating the noise floor, percentile of data points
            examined below which to consider noise. Calculated using
            `stats.scoreatpercentile`.  Default is 10.

        Returns
        -------
        peaks_indices : ndarray
            Indices of the locations in the `vector` where peaks were found.
            The list is sorted.

        See Also
        --------
        cwt
            Continuous wavelet transform.
        find_peaks
            Find peaks inside a signal based on peak properties.

        Notes
        -----
        This approach was designed for finding sharp peaks among noisy data,
        however with proper parameter selection it should function well for
        different peak shapes.

        The algorithm is as follows:
         1. Perform a continuous wavelet transform on `vector`, for the supplied
            `widths`. This is a convolution of `vector` with `wavelet(width)` for
            each width in `widths`. See `cwt`
         2. Identify "ridge lines" in the cwt matrix. These are relative maxima
            at each row, connected across adjacent rows. See identify_ridge_lines
         3. Filter the ridge_lines using filter_ridge_lines.
